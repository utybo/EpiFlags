# EpiFlags

EpiFlags is a repository which contains source SVG files for logo and logo 
concepts for EPITA International servers.

## The servers

In the fourth semester at the "EPITA" school, students go abroad in many 
countries. In order to better organize themselves, the students have created
Discord servers, and these servers have logos which are inconsistent or straight
up... not nice.

## Copyright notice

The EPITA logo embedded in all flags was recreated from the ground up. This
project is not endorsed by the EPITA school. The EPITA logo may be a registered
trademark, please inform yourself!

## Logos general design guidelines

Follow the logo for Finland in priority, as it is the first one that was made.

The general guidelines are:

* **The position and scaling of the EPITA logo must be left as is.**
  This is because the logos follow the same shape as the "official" Discord 
  school servers in terms of position and scaling.
* The flag of the country must be embedded in the logo, unless the flag really
  does not fit in nicely.
* The background must have a subtle gradient (bottom darker than top). The color
  must be either 
  * A darker or brighter version of the colors of the flag
  * A color that appears on the country's coat of arms
* Keep in mind that Discord server logos are circles that expand to rectangles
  with rounded corners when hovered over or selected.

## TO-DO

The ultimate goal is to have one logo per destination, even if a Discord server
does not exist yet.
